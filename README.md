# Wake2

A text-based adventure game engine built in java, for the purpose of learning the lanugage.

Todo:

    -fix keyword ALL ("get all" and "drop all" are not working as expected)
    -remove articles and adverbs from tokenized imput (or maybe not, there are 150 adverbs alone)
    -item interactions (key unlocks door, switch opens passageway)
    -containers (chest contains items, unlock chest, open chest)
    -multi-word item names (silver key, rusty key)
    -Storytime!

    maybe:
    -read map data from file (making this into an interpreter)
